| __SPEAKERS EXCERPT:-__ |
| --------- |
| In this session, we would like to share with you our insights of a self-service modeling platform within the business area Trading & Sales at Axpo. MoNet (Models Network) is intended to be an ecosystem where modelers and Quant share Code and best practices while implementing the right governance around models. Itâ€™s a platform that fosters collaboration and interaction to generate model-based business value, streamline critical processes and migrate them to the Azure cloud. Hence, we are relying heavily on Azure DevOps CI/CD for managing our codebase and deployment pipelines. Together with Cloud Platform Team, we have built a comprehensive set of automated DevOps processes, helping us to reduce the time to market of new ideas and scaling DevOps best practices with the entire organization. |
